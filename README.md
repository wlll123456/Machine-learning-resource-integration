# Machine-learning-resource-integration
Machine learning will be started in November 2021, and related resources will be organized. During the learning process, I found that learning resources are diverse, and some codes use old frameworks: Dr. Huang Haiguang uses tensorflow version 1.0 in his notes. I plan to share my learning resources, update my notes, and supervise learning.
